## Experiments and Results





### 1. Text-to-Image

> We use the DDPM [1] sampler with 500 steps and a guidance scale of 7.5. Images are generated with 512×512 pixels. Models are used in half precision (float16).

<div align="center">Figure 1: Text-to-image remote sensing image generation given prompts related to different disaster type. Prompt = f"A satellite image of town suffering from {disaster_type}", where disaster_type takes flooding, wildfire,hurricane,tornado,earthquake and volcanic eruption from left to right respectively. The model used from top to bottom are sd2,sdxl,sd3 and diffusionsat respectively.</div>

More Varients (using different seeds only)

### 2. Image-to-Image Translation

> We use the DDPM [1] sampler with 500 steps and a guidance scale of 5.0. Images are generated with 512×512 pixels. Models are used in half precision (float16). The image editing method is SDEdit [2].

<div align="center">Figure 2: Image-to-image remote sensing image generation given prompts related to different disaster type. From left to right, images are in the order of predicted pre-event image, ground truth pre-event image, ground truth post-event image and predicted post-event image. Pre-to-post prompt = f"A satellite image  after being affected by {disaster_type}" while post-to-pre prompt =f"A satellite image before being affected by {disaster_type}", where disaster_type takes flooding, wildfire,hurricane,tornado,earthquake and volcanic eruption from top to bottom respectively. All images are generated with sd2 while ground truth images are derived from xBD. We use guidingscale as 7.0 here.</div>

### 3. Interpretation from Attention Map Visualization

We use DaaM [3] to visualize how diffusion models understand prompt by visualizing the attention map. Here, we take flooding as an example.

> We use the DDPM sampler with 500 steps and a guidance scale of 5.0. Images are generated with 512×512 pixels. Models are used in half precision (float16). The image editing method is SDEdit. All experiments are done on sd2.

##### Condition Image Generation Technique - DiffEdit (integrated in `diffusers`)

[Huggingface/Diffusers/API/Pipelines/DiffEdit](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/api/pipelines/diffedit)

<div align="center"><img src="./assets/discussion-img/DiffEdit_demos.png">In semantic image editing the goal is to modify an input image based on a textual query, while otherwise leaving the image as close as possible to the original. In our DIFFEDIT [4] approach, a mask generation module determines which part of the image should be edited, and an encoder infers the latents, to provide inputs to a text-conditional diffusion model which produces the image edit.<img src="./assets/discussion-img/DiffEdit_overview.png">The three steps of DIFFEDIT. Step 1: we add noise to the input image, and denoise it: once conditioned on the query text, and once conditioned on a reference text (or unconditionally). We derive a mask based on the difference in the denoising results. Step 2: we encode the input image with DDIM, to estimate the latents corresponding to the input image. Step 3: we perform DDIM decoding conditioned on the text query, using the inferred mask to replace the background with pixel values coming from the encoding process at the corresponding timestep.</div>

##### [Overcome 77 tokens in Stable Diffusion (diffusers)](https://medium.com/@natsunoyuki/using-long-prompts-with-the-diffusers-package-with-prompt-embeddings-819657943050)

**Solution: Use prompt embedding instead of prompt.**

The first step is to tokenize the prompt and the negative prompt, assuming that the prompt is longer than the negative prompt.

```python
input_ids = pipeline.tokenizer(
    prompt, 
    return_tensors="pt", 
    truncation=False
).input_ids.to("cuda")
```

For example, the long prompt provided by [wnwntk511 on CivitAI](https://civitai.com/images/1321964?modelVersionId=105253&prioritizedUserIds=587535&period=AllTime&sort=Most+Reactions&limit=20) are tokenized to a Tensor with 256 elements (which will be truncated to 77 by CLIP):

```python
>>> input_ids
>>> tensor([[49406,   263,  1125,   268, 16157,   267,  1532,  1125,   267, 12066,
           267,   949,  3027,   267,   279,   330,   267,    84,  4414,   267,
          6323,  1125,   267, 21682,   912,   620,   267,  1994,  9977,   267,

          1215, 22984, 28215,   267, 16575,  4605, 12609,   267, 11444,   537,
         29616,  2353,   267,  3077, 27897,   267,  1860,  3073,   267,  3049,

           281,   272,   269,   275,  2361,   263,   272,  1611,   267,  5797,
          1611,   281,   272,   269,   274,  2361,   263, 25602,  1093,   539,
           320,  2582,  8405,  3540,  3874,   530,   320,  3694,   539,   320,
          3144,  1704,   267,  3184,  1093,   267,  1769,   537, 12587,   267,
         13106,   930,   281,   272,   269,   274,  2361,   263, 10789,  5135,
         18503,   267,  1476,  1774, 16167,  3940,   593,  3946,  2614,   281,
           272,   269,   274,  2361,   263, 40171,  7355,   267,  6631,   267,
          3254,   320,  8670,   537,  1070,  1538, 11356,   267,  4652,   267,
           820,  5684,   320, 11356,   281,   272,   269,   275,  2361,   263,
          9920,   320,  1205,  4040,   525,   893,   281,   272,   269,   273,
          2361, 42176,   696,  7373,   267, 49407]], device='cuda:0')
```

After tokenizing the prompt and negative prompt, the next step is to encode the tokens into embeddings. The result for the prompt is a Tensor of shape `[1, 256, 768]`.

```python
concat_embeds = []
# max_length=77
for i in range(0, input_ids.shape[-1], max_length):
    concat_embeds.append(
        pipe.text_encoder(
            input_ids[:, i: i + max_length]
        )[0]
    )
prompt_embeds = torch.cat(concat_embeds, dim=1)
>>> prompt_embeds.shape
>>> torch.Size([1, 256, 768])
```

The prompt and negative prompt embeddings can then be fed into the pipeline without being truncated, and the diffusion model will use the full prompt to generate images!

```python
new_img = pipe(
    prompt_embeds = prompt_embeds,
    negative_prompt_embeds = negative_prompt_embeds,
    width = width,
    height = height,
    guidance_scale = guidance_scale,
    num_inference_steps = num_inference_steps,
    num_images_per_prompt = 1,
    generator = torch.manual_seed(seed),
).images
```

> [!IMPORTANT] Comment@Sakura
> I think this solution works well that do little harm to diffusion model itself. Although, in this example, it is applied in the inference step, I suppose it be plausible in the training/fine-tuning step also!.
>
> The reason why i think this long embedding is acceptable is that text embedding is fed into SD Encoder & Decoder block with cross-attention, so there is no worry how long it is. BUT, as stable diffusion is pretrained on text embedding no more than 77 tokens, we adopt longer prompt embedding in the further-training/fine-tuning step can be somehow less effective. Although, long prompt might distract the attention, where important prompt is not correctly noticed by model.

##### Data Augmentation in Training

As we notice [Stable Diffusion v2.1](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-1) [7] is pretrained on LAION-5B [8] with 512×512 image size, we consider the fine-tuning step image input size as 512×512 is more suitable and consistent. If we are going to use other training size, take a data curriculum where first training on 512×512 then move to 256×256 (which is considered as a generalization -> specification).

Also, as xBD [6] dataset only contains ~11k pre-event&post-event image pairs with 512×512, we consider following data augmentation methods to increase the training dataset.

1. Divide each image into four 256×256 patches (and their horizontal reflections). This increase the size of training set by a factor of 8. This method is first introduced in AlexNet [9] in 2012.
2. ~~Perform PCA on the set of RGB pixel values.~~ This method is also followed by AlexNet [9], but I do not recommend.
3. Reuse the image pairs for training but with different prompt style. The first 11k pairs are using prompt generated by CogVLM2+T5 within 77 tokens. Then the following can be a) long prompt (200-300 tokens, using embedding techniques mentioned above for input) by CogVLM2 b) divided long prompt (200-300 tokens) into 3×normal prompt(<77tokens) c) captions generated by [MG-Transformer](https://github.com/One-paper-luck/MG-Transformer) [2] and [PKG-Transformer](https://github.com/One-paper-luck/PKG-Transformer) [3]
